-The prompt:
At the age of 16 everyone gets teleported into a small room. In front of you is a table with all kinds of meals from apples to gourmet meats. 
Whatever you take a bite of will determine what superpower you'll get. You are the first person to take a bite of the table itself.

-The response:
That probably wasn't the greatest idea. There's a plethora of amazing, tasty choices in front of you... and you chose the hardest possible... option? Does the table even count? Wood isn't exactly edible, but you didn't think that part over yet. It's going to suck being you in a few hours, but hopefully you'll have some cool powers by then to make up for it. There's no way anyone else was dumb enough to try this before.

You aren't feeling too good after taking a whole bite of a woodworking project. Your stomach is churning and roaring because of the dense wood going through your digestive system. This isn't good. You feel like you are tingling inside, everywhere in your body. However, you don't think about the feeling much. Consuming wood probably comes with delusions perhaps. You sit down on a chair next to the poor table you had a snack from and bury your face in your hands, beginning to sweat as the realization of your ridiculous decision comes to you.

When you finally start to calm down and take your hands away from your face, you notice that they are... dry? No, that’s not the right word. Your skin looks almost like tree bark. It’s completely dry. You hope that you are being fooled, that your “super” power isn’t something so useless and ironic.
